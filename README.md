Versioning:
I am planning to use semantic versioning for the application backend as well as for the frontend. The structure is as follows:
<major>.<minor>.<patch>
Major: Major changes in the code which is incompatible with previous code.
Minor: Adding new features or changes
Patch: Bug fixes
The versioning is mainly for developmental purpose. Since the versioning starting from 1.x.x, the urls starts with 'api'.


## Prerequisites:
I am using VSCode for my development and its integrated terminal. Any IDE and command prompt is enough.
I have enabled 'autosave features'. So, 'save' won't be mentioned in the follwing instructions.

## Initial setup
In terminal:

mkdir Remedy_v2_backend
cd Remedy_v2_backend
pipenv install django
pipenv shell
django-admin startproject backend .

Initialize a new git repository
```
git init
```

Create two file named '.env' and .gitignore
```
touch .env
```
```
touch .gitignore
```

Add .env to the gitignore file

Install 'Python-decouple' package
```
pip install python-decouple
```

Now copy the 'secret key from settings.py to .env file.
In the .env file it should be something like the following:
```
SECRET_KEY = 'the_secret_key'
```
In the settings.py file, add the following lines:
```
from decouple import config
SECRET_KEY = config("SECRET_KEY")
```

If having any issue with decouple, Select the proper interpreter in VS Code
